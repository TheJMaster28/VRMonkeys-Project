How this project is set up is like a basic Unity Project. Most of our work is in the Assets folder

Here we have our imported assets and our custom assets(OurAssets) located. We also have a Scripts folder where all of our scripts are located. In our Scenes folder, this is where are two scenes that are game uses.
